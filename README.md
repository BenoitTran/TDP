# Tropical Dynamic Programming (TDP)

Two Julia 1.4. Notebooks to illustrate TDP in a linear-polyhedral example of Multistage Stochastic optimization Problem.

One Julia 1.7.3 Notebook to illustrade TDP in a linear-quadratic example of Multistage (Deterministic) optimization Problem.

See inside each notebook for details.
